        <h1>I love dogs</h1>

        <p class="text">The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)
            is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, and is characterized by an upturning
            tail.</p> 
            
         <p class="text">The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf
            is the dog's nearest living relative. 
            The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000
            years ago, before the development of agriculture.</p>
           
         <p class="text"> Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals
            and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>
